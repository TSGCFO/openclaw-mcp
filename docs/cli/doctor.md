Health checks + quick fixes for the gateway and channels.Related:

- Security audit: [Security](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/security)

## [​](https://docs.openclaw.ai/cli/doctor\#examples)  Examples

```
openclaw doctor
openclaw doctor --repair
openclaw doctor --deep
openclaw doctor --repair --non-interactive
openclaw doctor --generate-gateway-token
```

## [​](https://docs.openclaw.ai/cli/doctor\#options)  Options

- `--no-workspace-suggestions`: disable workspace memory/search suggestions
- `--yes`: accept defaults without prompting
- `--repair`: apply recommended non-service repairs without prompting; gateway service installs and rewrites still require interactive confirmation or explicit gateway commands
- `--fix`: alias for `--repair`
- `--force`: apply aggressive repairs, including overwriting custom service config when needed
- `--non-interactive`: run without prompts; safe migrations and non-service repairs only
- `--generate-gateway-token`: generate and configure a gateway token
- `--deep`: scan system services for extra gateway installs

Notes:

- Interactive prompts (like keychain/OAuth fixes) only run when stdin is a TTY and `--non-interactive` is **not** set. Headless runs (cron, Telegram, no terminal) will skip prompts.
- Performance: non-interactive `doctor` runs skip eager plugin loading so headless health checks stay fast. Interactive sessions still fully load plugins when a check needs their contribution.
- `--fix` (alias for `--repair`) writes a backup to `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json.bak` and drops unknown config keys, listing each removal.
- `doctor --fix --non-interactive` reports missing or stale gateway service definitions but does not install or rewrite them outside update repair mode. Run `openclaw gateway install` for a missing service, or `openclaw gateway install --force` when you intentionally want to replace the launcher.
- State integrity checks now detect orphan transcript files in the sessions directory. Archiving them as `.deleted.<timestamp>` requires an interactive confirmation; `--fix`, `--yes`, and headless runs leave them in place.
- Doctor also scans `~/.openclaw/cron/jobs.json` (or `cron.store`) for legacy cron job shapes and can rewrite them in place before the scheduler has to auto-normalize them at runtime.
- On Linux, doctor warns when the user’s crontab still runs legacy `~/.openclaw/bin/ensure-whatsapp.sh`; that script is no longer maintained and can log false WhatsApp gateway outages when cron lacks the systemd user-bus environment.
- Doctor cleans legacy plugin dependency staging state created by older OpenClaw versions. It also repairs missing configured downloadable plugins when the registry can resolve them, and the 2026.5.2 doctor pass automatically installs downloadable plugins that an older config already uses before marking the config touched for that release.
- Doctor repairs stale plugin config by removing missing plugin ids from `plugins.allow`/`plugins.entries`, plus matching dangling channel config, heartbeat targets, and channel model overrides when plugin discovery is healthy.
- Doctor quarantines invalid plugin config by disabling the affected `plugins.entries.<id>` entry and removing its invalid `config` payload. Gateway startup already skips only that bad plugin so other plugins and channels can keep running.
- Set `OPENCLAW_SERVICE_REPAIR_POLICY=external` when another supervisor owns the gateway lifecycle. Doctor still reports gateway/service health and applies non-service repairs, but skips service install/start/restart/bootstrap and legacy service cleanup.
- On Linux, doctor ignores inactive extra gateway-like systemd units and does not rewrite command/entrypoint metadata for a running systemd gateway service during repair. Stop the service first or use `openclaw gateway install --force` when you intentionally want to replace the active launcher.
- Doctor auto-migrates legacy flat Talk config (`talk.voiceId`, `talk.modelId`, and friends) into `talk.provider` \+ `talk.providers.<provider>`.
- Repeat `doctor --fix` runs no longer report/apply Talk normalization when the only difference is object key order.
- Doctor includes a memory-search readiness check and can recommend `openclaw configure --section model` when embedding credentials are missing.
- Doctor warns when no command owner is configured. The command owner is the human operator account allowed to run owner-only commands and approve dangerous actions. DM pairing only lets someone talk to the bot; if you approved a sender before first-owner bootstrap existed, set `commands.ownerAllowFrom` explicitly.
- Doctor warns when Codex-mode agents are configured and personal Codex CLI assets exist in the operator’s Codex home. Local Codex app-server launches use isolated per-agent homes, so use `openclaw migrate codex --dry-run` to inventory assets that should be promoted deliberately.
- Doctor warns when skills allowed for the default agent are unavailable in the current runtime environment because bins, env vars, config, or OS requirements are missing. `doctor --fix` can disable those unavailable skills with `skills.entries.<skill>.enabled=false`; install/configure the missing requirement instead when you want to keep the skill active.
- If sandbox mode is enabled but Docker is unavailable, doctor reports a high-signal warning with remediation (`install Docker` or `openclaw config set agents.defaults.sandbox.mode off`).
- If `gateway.auth.token`/`gateway.auth.password` are SecretRef-managed and unavailable in the current command path, doctor reports a read-only warning and does not write plaintext fallback credentials.
- If channel SecretRef inspection fails in a fix path, doctor continues and reports a warning instead of exiting early.
- After state-directory migrations, doctor warns when enabled default Telegram or Discord accounts depend on env fallback and `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` or `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` is unavailable to the doctor process.
- Telegram `allowFrom` username auto-resolution (`doctor --fix`) requires a resolvable Telegram token in the current command path. If token inspection is unavailable, doctor reports a warning and skips auto-resolution for that pass.

## [​](https://docs.openclaw.ai/cli/doctor\#macos-launchctl-env-overrides)  macOS: `launchctl` env overrides

If you previously ran `launchctl setenv OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN ...` (or `...PASSWORD`), that value overrides your config file and can cause persistent “unauthorized” errors.

```
launchctl getenv OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN
launchctl getenv OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PASSWORD

launchctl unsetenv OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN
launchctl unsetenv OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PASSWORD
```
