\# Migration guide

OpenClaw supports three migration paths: importing from another agent system, moving an existing install to a new machine, and upgrading a plugin in place.

\## Import from another agent system

Use the bundled migration providers to bring instructions, MCP servers, skills, model config, and (opt-in) API keys into OpenClaw. Plans are previewed before any change, secrets are redacted in reports, and apply is backed by a verified backup.

 Import Claude Code and Claude Desktop state, including \`CLAUDE.md\`, MCP servers, skills, and project commands.

 Import Hermes config, providers, MCP servers, memory, skills, and supported \`.env\` keys.


The CLI entry point is \[\`openclaw migrate\`\](/cli/migrate). Onboarding can also offer migration when it detects a known source (\`openclaw onboard --flow import\`).

\## Move OpenClaw to a new machine

Copy the \*\*state directory\*\* (\`~/.openclaw/\` by default) and your \*\*workspace\*\* to preserve:

\\* \*\*Config\*\* — \`openclaw.json\` and all gateway settings.
\\* \*\*Auth\*\* — per-agent \`auth-profiles.json\` (API keys plus OAuth), plus any channel or provider state under \`credentials/\`.
\\* \*\*Sessions\*\* — conversation history and agent state.
\\* \*\*Channel state\*\* — WhatsApp login, Telegram session, and similar.
\\* \*\*Workspace files\*\* — \`MEMORY.md\`, \`USER.md\`, skills, and prompts.

 Run \`openclaw status\` on the old machine to confirm your state directory path. Custom profiles use \`~/.openclaw-/\` or a path set via \`OPENCLAW\_STATE\_DIR\`.

\### Migration steps

 On the \*\*old\*\* machine, stop the gateway so files are not changing mid-copy, then archive:

 \`\`\`bash theme={"theme":{"light":"min-light","dark":"min-dark"}}
 openclaw gateway stop
 cd ~
 tar -czf openclaw-state.tgz .openclaw
 \`\`\`

 If you use multiple profiles (for example \`~/.openclaw-work\`), archive each separately.

 \[Install\](/install) the CLI (and Node if needed) on the new machine. It is fine if onboarding creates a fresh \`~/.openclaw/\`. You will overwrite it next.

 Transfer the archive via \`scp\`, \`rsync -a\`, or an external drive, then extract:

 \`\`\`bash theme={"theme":{"light":"min-light","dark":"min-dark"}}
 cd ~
 tar -xzf openclaw-state.tgz
 \`\`\`

 Ensure hidden directories were included and file ownership matches the user that will run the gateway.

 On the new machine, run \[Doctor\](/gateway/doctor) to apply config migrations and repair services:

 \`\`\`bash theme={"theme":{"light":"min-light","dark":"min-dark"}}
 openclaw doctor
 openclaw gateway restart
 openclaw status
 \`\`\`


If Telegram or Discord uses the default env fallback (\`TELEGRAM\_BOT\_TOKEN\` or \`DISCORD\_BOT\_TOKEN\`), verify the migrated state-dir \`.env\` contains those keys without printing the secret values:

\`\`\`bash theme={"theme":{"light":"min-light","dark":"min-dark"}}
awk -F= '/^(TELEGRAM\_BOT\_TOKEN\|DISCORD\_BOT\_TOKEN)=/ { print $1 "=present" }' ~/.openclaw/.env
\`\`\`

\`openclaw doctor\` also warns when an enabled default Telegram or Discord account has no configured token and the matching env variable is unavailable to the doctor process.

\### Common pitfalls

 If the old gateway used \`--profile\` or \`OPENCLAW\_STATE\_DIR\` and the new one does not, channels will appear logged out and sessions will be empty. Launch the gateway with the \*\*same\*\* profile or state-dir you migrated, then rerun \`openclaw doctor\`.

 The config file alone is not enough. Model auth profiles live under \`agents//agent/auth-profiles.json\`, and channel and provider state lives under \`credentials/\`. Always migrate the \*\*entire\*\* state directory.

 If you copied as root or switched users, the gateway may fail to read credentials. Ensure the state directory and workspace are owned by the user running the gateway.

 If your UI points at a \*\*remote\*\* gateway, the remote host owns sessions and workspace. Migrate the gateway host itself, not your local laptop. See \[FAQ\](/help/faq#where-things-live-on-disk).

 The state directory contains auth profiles, channel credentials, and other provider state. Store backups encrypted, avoid insecure transfer channels, and rotate keys if you suspect exposure.


\### Verification checklist

On the new machine, confirm:

\\* \[ \] \`openclaw status\` shows the gateway running.
\\* \[ \] Channels are still connected (no re-pairing needed).
\\* \[ \] The dashboard opens and shows existing sessions.
\\* \[ \] Workspace files (memory, configs) are present.

\## Upgrade a plugin in place

In-place plugin upgrades preserve the same plugin id and config keys but may move on-disk state into the current layout. Plugin-specific upgrade guides live alongside their channels:

\\* \[Matrix migration\](/channels/matrix-migration): encrypted-state recovery limits, automatic snapshot behavior, and manual recovery commands.
